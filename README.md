🎮 Game Overview

Inferno begins with the player in a quiet, ominous bedroom — Level 1: Limbo — where something unthinkable happens. This moment becomes the catalyst for a symbolic descent through the layers of sin, each represented as a standalone gameplay challenge.

Your journey ends where it began… but transformed.

🕳️ Levels & Gameplay
Level 1 — Limbo

A surreal, oppressive bedroom setting. The game begins with a disturbing act by the player character that triggers the descent. Minimal interaction, heavy atmosphere, and a subtle narrative opening.

Level 2 — Lust

A level themed around temptation and avoidance.
Your goal: Evade the manifestations of temptation that attempt to pull you in.
Mechanics focus on movement, timing, and resisting the easy path.

Level 3 — Gluttony & Greed

Two sins merged into one chaotic chase sequence.
A massive fat demon relentlessly pursues you.
Your tools for survival:

Collect healthy food items to maintain stamina and health

Avoid junk food, which drains your life

Outmaneuver and outrun the demon long enough to escape

A mix of runner gameplay and resource management.

Level 4 — Anger

A combat-focused arena where you must fight your way past hordes of aggressive gremlins.
Defeat enough enemies to unlock the exit and progress.
This level showcases the game’s melee/ranged attack systems and enemy AI.

Final Level — Treachery

The final confrontation.
A symbolic boss that represents the ultimate betrayal — of others, of yourself, of truth.
This boss cannot be beaten. Its victory is inevitable, and its strike shatters the reality of the nightmare.

🌅 Ending — Awakening

You return to Limbo, but the bedroom is no longer dark, distorted, and oppressive.
It’s your real bedroom.
Everything is normal.
You are alive.
And you’re left with the realization that the act you committed at the beginning — the one that started the descent — was wrong.
The “Inferno” was your mind's way of confronting it.
